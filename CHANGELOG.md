- **Rapid Skip Playbar Desync**: Fixed playbar state not updating correctly when skipping tracks rapidly.
- **Like Action 400 Errors**: Fixed `400 Bad Request` failures when liking songs.
- **macOS Media Integration Regressions**: Fixed macOS media support regressions in TUI handlers.
- **Global Song Counter Reliability**: Fixed issues affecting global song counter updates.

### Internal

- **Dependency Maintenance**: Bumped Rust minor dependency updates ([#104](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/104)) and refreshed `Cargo.lock`.
- **Code Quality/Formatting**: Fixed clippy warnings and applied rustfmt cleanups ([#106](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/106)).

## [0.36.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Vesper Theme Preset**: Added a new built-in `Vesper` theme preset ([#98](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/98)).
- **Playlist Track Management Actions**: Added flows to add tracks to playlists from track-table contexts and quick-add the currently playing track from anywhere (`W`) ([#99](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/99)).
- **Playlist Track Removal Dialog**: Added remove-from-playlist action (`x` in playlist track tables) with a confirmation dialog and vim-style `h`/`l` confirmation navigation ([#99](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/99)).

### Fixed

- **Deterministic Duplicate Removal in Playlists**: Removing a track now targets only the selected occurrence by position instead of broadly deleting matching duplicates; when mutation payload safety cannot be guaranteed (for local/unavailable rows), spotatui now reports a clear status error instead of mutating the wrong rows ([#99](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/99)).
- **Recurring Spirc Startup Failures with Cached Streaming Credentials**: If Spirc initialization fails or times out while using cached streaming credentials, spotatui now clears stale `streaming_cache/credentials.json`, requests fresh streaming OAuth credentials, and retries initialization once before falling back.


## [0.36.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **Expired Token Startup Loop**: Startup now validates cached auth tokens and forces a clean re-auth only when the cache is stale/invalid, preventing repeated `status code 400 Bad Request` failures on launch.
- **Recurring 401 Error Modal**: Direct Spotify API calls now refresh the access token on `401 Unauthorized` and retry, preventing the error screen from immediately reappearing after dismissal when a token expires mid-session.
- **Windows Compilation Regression**: Fixed the Windows build break introduced in `0.36.0` ([#97](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/97)).

## [0.36.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **First-Run Auth Mode Selection**: New users now choose between two setup paths during `client.yml` creation: (1) use the shared ncspot client ID, or (2) use ncspot with a user-provided fallback client ID.
- **Automatic OAuth Client Fallback**: If authentication or profile verification fails with the primary client ID, spotatui now retries automatically with `fallback_client_id` when configured.
- **Client-Specific Token Caches**: OAuth tokens are now stored per client ID to avoid collisions when switching between primary and fallback credentials.
- **Spotify API Compatibility Layer**: Added a raw request/normalization path for Spotify's February 2026 payload changes so responses can still map into existing models.
- **Auth Reconfiguration Command**: Added `--reconfigure-auth` to rerun client authentication setup without deleting config files.
- **One-Time Auth Migration Prompt**: Existing users are prompted once to update authentication setup after config format changes.

### Changed

- **Authentication Flow Migrated to PKCE**: spotatui now authenticates with `AuthCodePkceSpotify` for better compatibility with current Spotify client-ID-based flows.
- **Setup Prompt Order**: On first launch, global song counter opt-in is now prompted after client-ID setup (option 1/2), matching the onboarding sequence.
- **ncspot Redirect URI Handling**: The shared ncspot client path now uses its expected redirect URI and callback port (`http://127.0.0.1:8989/login`).
- **Help Text and Migration Copy**: Updated `--help` and startup migration wording to reflect the new authentication/configuration flow.

### Fixed

- **Spotify Feb 2026 Breaking API Changes**: Resolved multiple regressions for newly created/restricted apps, including missing-field deserialization failures (`tracks`, `track`, `followers`, `external_ids`, `available_markets`, and related shape changes).
- **Discover Reliability**: Reworked Discover top tracks/artists mix loading to avoid removed endpoints and to degrade gracefully when recommendation endpoints are unavailable.
- **Library/Follow Endpoint Migration**: Updated save/follow checks and mutations to use the new `/me/library` and `/me/library/contains` style flows for tracks, albums, shows, artists, and playlists.
- **Startup/Discover 429 Handling**: Added Spotify rate-limit retries with `Retry-After` support, global API pacing, and non-fatal UI handling for transient 429 responses.
- **Excess Startup API Pressure**: Reduced repeated liked-state checks on playback polling so idle startup no longer spams containment checks.
- **Random Playback Poll Network Failures**: Transient request-send/network errors during playback polling now auto-retry with status messaging instead of forcing the blocking error modal.

## [0.35.7] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Playlist Folder Navigation**: Playlist folders from your Spotify library are now displayed as a navigable hierarchy in the UI, with optimized background fetching and immediate folder structure rendering ([#92](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/92))

### Fixed

- **Seek Was Completely Unusable**: Rapid seeking (`<`/`>` keys) would freeze the player, corrupt audio, cause looping glitches, and require Ctrl+C to kill. Fixed by throttling native seeks to 50ms and API seeks to 200ms, queueing pending seeks, and ignoring stale position events after seeking (thanks @El-Mundos - [#86](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/86))
- **MPRIS Position Tracking and Seeking**: Fixed relative seek calculation (was treating offset as absolute position), added `SetPosition` support for widgets using absolute positioning, and emit `Seeked` signals so external clients update their displays (thanks @El-Mundos - [#85](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/85))
- **MPRIS Shuffle and Loop Support**: MPRIS now advertises shuffle and loop status capabilities so desktop media controls and `playerctl` can toggle shuffle and repeat modes bidirectionally (thanks @El-Mundos - [#86](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/86))
- **Progress Reset on Resume**: Resuming playback on external devices no longer briefly flashes 0:00 before the API returns the real position (thanks @El-Mundos - [#86](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/86))
- **Seek Timing Bug**: Fixed a timing issue where queued API seeks didn't start the position-ignore window, causing the UI to jump back to stale positions during rapid seeks (thanks @El-Mundos - [#86](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/86))
- **Help Menu Closing App**: Dismissing the help menu no longer closes the entire application; it is now handled as a proper route (thanks @dpnova - [#89](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/89))
- **Playlist Folder Refresh Races**: Guarded against background refresh races and unified playlist resolution logic to prevent inconsistent folder state ([#92](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/92))

### Changed

- **Dependency Updates**: Updated `clap` to 4.5.57 and `anyhow` to 1.0.101 ([#90](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/pull/90))

## [0.35.6] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **MPRIS Album Art Metadata (Linux)**: MPRIS metadata now includes artwork URLs so desktop media controls can show album covers.
- **Automated Homebrew Publishing**: Added a `publish-homebrew` release job to update the Homebrew tap formula on tagged releases.
- **Config Directory .gitignore**: Automatically creates a `.gitignore` in `~/.config/spotatui/` to protect sensitive files (`client.yml`, `streaming_cache/credentials.json`) from being accidentally committed when users sync their dotfiles.

### Fixed

- **Slim Build Compilation**: Fixed feature gating and conditional imports so builds without `streaming` compile cleanly.
- **Update Check Arc Cloning**: Corrected `Arc` cloning in the async update check task.
- **AUR PKGBUILD Checksum Updates**: Reworked checksum replacement using `awk` and added validation checks to prevent malformed PKGBUILD updates in release workflows.
- **macOS Streaming Audio Backend**: Defaulted `librespot-playback` to `portaudio-backend` on macOS to avoid pipe-sink fallback issues.
- **Reqwest Dependency Resolution**: Made `reqwest` mandatory to prevent missing-dependency build failures (fixes #73).

### Changed

- **Dependency Updates**: Updated `discord-rich-presence` to 1.1.0, `clap` to 4.5.56, `time` to 0.3.47, and `bytes` to 1.11.1.
- **Project Metadata and Docs**: Updated installation docs (Homebrew and Winget), funding metadata, and contributor acknowledgements.

## [0.35.5] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Settings Keybindings**: Add customizable keybindings for settings actions.

### Fixed

- **AUR Binary Package**: `spotatui-bin` is now automatically published alongside releases for faster installation on Arch Linux.

## [0.35.3] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Playbar Status Messages**: Added transient status messages in the playbar, used to notify when the saved playback device is unavailable and spotatui falls back to native streaming.

### Fixed

- **Startup Playback Device Selection**: Restored automatic selection of the last used playback device on startup, with graceful fallback to the native device when it is missing.
- **Native Device Activation Latency**: Made Spotify Connect activation non-blocking and reduced delays during device selection/playback.

### Changed

- **Home Screen Rendering**: Cached the home banner gradient and changelog parsing to reduce per-frame work.
- **Changelog Styling**: Changelog section headers now use theme colors for a softer, theme-consistent look.
- **Native Track Metadata**: Store a preformatted artist display string for faster playbar updates.
- **UI Render Loop**: Cache terminal size per tick to avoid repeated backend queries.

## [0.35.1] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

- **CLI Playback Crash**: Fixed crash when using `spotatui playback --like` or `--dislike` CLI commands ([#50](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/issues/50))
  - Root cause: Incorrect type access on clap `ArgGroup` caused type mismatch panic
  - Other `playback` flags (`--shuffle`, `--repeat`) were also affected

## [0.35.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- **Audio Visualization**: Real-time audio visualization with multiple display styles (requires `audio-viz` or `audio-viz-cpal` feature)
  - **Equalizer Mode**: Uses `tui-equalizer` with half-block bars and brightness effect
  - **Bar Graph Mode**: Uses `tui-bar-graph` with full-height vertical bars
  - Visualizer style can be configured in `config.yml` under `behavior.visualizer_style`
  - Supports custom color gradients via `colorgrad` integration
  - Dynamic frequency analysis displays while audio is playing
- **tui-equalizer Integration**: Added Josh McKinney's `tui-equalizer` widget for modern audio visualization

- **Dynamic Theme Gradients**: The home banner now features a dynamic, animated gradient that adapts to your current theme's colors
- **Heart Burst Animation**: Added a "heart burst" animation when liking a track for better visual feedback

### Changed

- **Upgraded to Ratatui 0.30**: Major framework upgrade from Ratatui 0.26 to 0.30
  - Replaced deprecated `Frame::size()` with `Frame::area()` across all UI components
  - Updated `App` size field to use `ratatui::layout::Size`
  - Refactored terminal initialization and main event loop for new Frame API
- **Upgraded to Crossterm 0.29**: Updated from Crossterm 0.27 to 0.29 for improved terminal handling
- **Modernized UI Aesthetics**: Refactored UI rendering for cleaner, more modern appearance
- **Audio Capture Lifecycle**: Refactored lazy audio capture initialization for better resource management
- **Unified Border Styles**: Standardized all UI borders (Home, Search, Playbar, Lists) to use `Rounded` corners for a more modern and consistent look

### Internal

- Added comprehensive `docs/RATATUI_0.30_CONVERSION.md` documenting the upgrade process
- Updated audio-viz feature flags to include new visualization dependencies
- Improved audio analysis widget architecture for better extensibility

## [0.34.6] - 2025-12-26

### Added

- **Sorting for Playlists, Albums, and Artists**: Press `,` to open a sort menu with multiple options
  - **Playlist Tracks**: Sort by Name, Date Added, Artist, Album, or Duration
  - **Saved Albums**: Sort by Name, Date Added, or Artist
  - **Saved Artists**: Sort by Name
  - Quick keyboard shortcuts: lowercase letter for ascending (e.g., `n` for Name), uppercase for descending (`N`)
  - Full playlist sorting fetches all tracks for proper cross-page sorting

### Fixed

- **Track Repeat Mode**: Fixed track repeat not working with native streaming player
  - Previously, selecting "Track" repeat mode only updated the UI but continued playing the next song
  - Now properly sends repeat commands to the librespot Spirc player
  - Correctly cycles through Off --> Context --> Track --> Off repeat modes

## [0.34.5] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **Discover: Top Tracks**: View your 50 most-listened songs with time range selection
  - Uses `[` / `]` keys to cycle time range: **4 weeks**, **6 months**, **All time**
  - Full track table with playback, queue, and navigation support

### Fixed

- **Made for You API Error**: Silenced JSON parsing error caused by Spotify's November 2024 API changes that restrict access to algorithmic playlists for apps without extended mode access
  - Previously showed cryptic `json parse error: invalid type: null, expected struct SimplifiedPlaylist` error
  - Now gracefully handles the API restriction without showing an error
- **Theme Background Colors**: Added full support for theme background colors
  - Fixed issue where light themes appeared dark due to terminal background fallback
  - UI widgets now strictly respect the theme's background set in `config.yml`

### Changed

- **Renamed "Made For You" to "Discover"**: The Library's first option is now called "Discover" with a new UI for personalized music features

## [0.34.4] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- **Crash Log on Panic**: When spotatui panics, it now writes a crash log to `~/.config/spotatui/spotatui_panic.log` to help debug hard-to-reproduce issues (set `SPOTATUI_PAUSE_ON_PANIC=1` on Windows to keep the terminal open after a panic).
- **macOS Now Playing Integration**: Native media key support on macOS via Apple's `MPRemoteCommandCenter` API (requires native streaming).
- **Streaming Debug Overrides**: Added `SPOTATUI_STREAMING_AUDIO_BACKEND` and `SPOTATUI_STREAMING_AUDIO_DEVICE` environment variables to help debug native streaming audio output issues.

### Fixed

- **Playlist Track Selection with Shuffle**: Fixed selecting a specific track in a playlist sometimes starting playback from the first track and desyncing the shuffle indicator/state.
- **Spirc Initialization Hangs/Crashes**: Added a startup timeout for native streaming (Spirc) initialization so spotatui can fall back to API-based playback instead of hanging indefinitely (configurable via `SPOTATUI_STREAMING_INIT_TIMEOUT_SECS`).

## [0.34.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Catppuccin Mocha Theme Preset**: Added the popular Catppuccin Mocha Lavender color scheme as a new built-in theme preset (thanks @MysteriousWolf - PR #19)
- **Nix Support**: Added Nix derivation and build instructions for Nix users (thanks @copeison - PR #16)
  - Basic Nix derivation for building spotatui
  - Documentation for Nix-based installation

### Fixed

- **ALSA Warnings and Lock Contention**: Fixed ALSA warnings and lock contention issues that could cause freezing when viewing liked songs (thanks @rawcode1337 - PR #18, fixes #17)
- **External Device Playback Controls**: Fixed play/pause, skip, and volume controls not working when using the native Spotify app as the active playback device (fixes #14)
- **Silent Crash During Streaming Init**: Panics during Spotify Connect (Spirc) initialization no longer exit silently in release builds, and are handled by falling back to API-based playback control (fixes #15, untested).

## [0.34.2] - 2025-12-13

### Added

- **Persistent Playback Device**: Saves the last used playback device (for example, `spotatui` or `spotifyd`) and re-selects it automatically on the next startup so playback resumes on the same device.

### Fixed

- **macOS SIGSEGV Crash on Startup**: Fixed segmentation fault when launching spotatui on macOS with Bluetooth audio devices connected
  - Switched from rodio to portaudio audio backend for macOS builds
  - Portaudio provides better compatibility with macOS CoreAudio and Bluetooth devices (AirPods, etc.)
  - Pre-built macOS binaries now use portaudio backend by default
  - Fixes crash during "Initializing Spirc" on macOS Sequoia and later

## [0.34.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **MPRIS D-Bus Integration (Linux)**: Desktop media control support for Linux users
  - Control spotatui via media keys (play/pause, next, previous)
  - Compatible with `playerctl` command-line tool
  - Desktop environment integration (GNOME, KDE media widgets)
  - Track metadata exposed (title, artist, album, duration)
  - Playback status and volume synced to D-Bus
  - Requires native streaming feature (enabled by default on Linux)

- **Multi-Page Playback Support**: Enhanced playback functionality for large playlists and saved tracks
  - Play seamlessly across all loaded pages, not just the current page
  - Automatically calculates correct track offset across multiple pages
  - Supports both saved tracks (Liked Songs) and playlists

- **Background Prefetching**: Intelligent prefetching system for improved performance
  - Automatically loads additional tracks in the background when viewing playlists or saved tracks
  - Prefetches up to 500 tracks (~10 pages) for seamless playback
  - Non-blocking implementation - prefetching runs in separate async tasks
  - Prefetched tracks are immediately available for playback without delay

### Fixed

- **First Song Playback Delay**: Fixed 5-10 second delay when playing the first song after startup
  - Root cause: Prefetch operations were blocking the network thread, preventing playback events from being processed
  - Fix: Converted prefetch operations to spawn as independent async tasks using `tokio::spawn()`
  - Result: Playback starts instantly while prefetching happens in the background

- **Track Skip Metadata Sync**: Implemented retry mechanism for track skip operations
  - Ensures Spotify API returns updated track metadata after skipping
  - Prevents showing stale track information in the UI
  - Improves reliability of track transitions


## [0.33.8] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

- **Smaller Binary Size**: Added Ratatui-recommended release optimizations, reducing binary size by ~62% (26MB → 9.9MB)
  - Enabled Link-Time Optimization (LTO)
  - Single codegen unit for better optimization
  - Strip debug symbols
  - Optimized for size (`opt-level = "s"`)
  - Thanks to zamazan4ik for the suggestion in Issue #5!

### Fixed

- **Next Track Skip Shows Stale Progress**: Fixed bug where skipping to the next track with native streaming would show stale progress from the previous song and appear paused
  - Root cause: `get_current_playback()` was preserving the old track's `is_playing` state (often `false` during transition), which overwrote the new track's correct state from the Spotify API
  - Fix: Only preserve volume, shuffle, and repeat states when native streaming is active - `is_playing` now comes from the API response or player events
  - Result: Playbar correctly shows "Playing" and reset progress when skipping tracks

- **Shuffle Not Actually Enabling with Native Streaming**: Shuffle preference is now sent to librespot on startup and when toggling, with device activation to ensure it applies; UI and saved config stay in sync so shuffle really plays shuffled.

- **Playbar Shows Old Track After Skip**: Fixed delay where playbar would briefly show the previous song's name/artist after skipping
  - Root cause: `native_track_info` (instant track info from native player) was unconditionally cleared when API response arrived, even if API returned stale data for the old track
  - Fix: Only clear `native_track_info` when API track name matches the native player's track
  - Result: Playbar immediately shows the new track's name from native player, only switching to API data when it catches up

## [0.33.7] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed

- **Artist View from Search**: Fixed issue where selecting an artist from search results would show a 404 error instead of loading the artist view
  - Root cause: The deprecated `related-artists` Spotify API endpoint was returning 404, blocking the entire artist view from loading
  - Fix: Made related artists fetch optional - artist view now loads successfully with albums and top tracks even if related artists endpoint fails
  - Related artists section will be empty when the endpoint is unavailable, but core artist information displays correctly

## [0.33.6] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **Persistent Volume**: Volume changes are saved immediately to `config.yml` and restored on startup so your level sticks between sessions
- **Persistent Shuffle**: Shuffle state is now saved and reapplied on launch, including when using native streaming, so you restart right where you left off
- (thanks u/Ratox for the ideas)

## [0.33.5] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed

- **Program Hanging on Exit**: Fixed issue where pressing "q" to exit the TUI would close the interface but leave the program running in the background
  - Root cause: Network thread continued running because the IO channel sender was never dropped, keeping the channel open indefinitely
  - Fix: Added `close_io_channel()` method that explicitly drops the sender when exiting, allowing the network thread to terminate gracefully
  - Result: Program now exits cleanly without requiring an additional Ctrl+C

- **Butter-Smooth Playbar Updates**: Completely rewrote playbar progress calculation for silky-smooth updates
  - **Previously**: Progress jumped every 5 seconds when the Spotify API was polled, causing visible stuttering
  - **Now**: Smooth incremental updates every tick (16ms by default, configurable via `tick_rate_milliseconds`)
  - **How it works**:
    - On each tick, progress increments by the tick rate when playing
    - Resyncs with Spotify API every 5 seconds to prevent drift
    - Responds to API updates within 300ms for instant feedback on play/pause/seek
  - **Result**: Progress bar now flows smoothly like a native music player, not in 5-second jumps
  - Optimized code paths to reduce CPU usage and unnecessary calculations

- **First Song Pause Bug**: Fixed issue where pausing the first song after startup required pressing pause twice
  - Root cause: `is_playing` state wasn't immediately updated to `true` when starting playback, staying `false` until API poll completed
  - Fix: Now immediately sets `is_playing = true` when `StartPlayback` succeeds, matching the behavior of resume playback
  - Result: Pause button works correctly on first press, even immediately after selecting a song

## [0.33.4] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **Instant Track Skip with Native Streaming**: When using native streaming, skipping tracks (n/p keys) now updates the playbar instantly
  - Previously, the UI waited for the Spotify API response before updating, causing a noticeable delay where you'd hear the new song while the playbar still showed the old song
  - Now uses the native player's `next()`/`prev()` methods via the Spirc controller for immediate skip
  - Added `NativeTrackInfo` - extracts track name, artists, and duration from librespot's `TrackChanged` event for instant playbar display
  - The playbar now shows native player info immediately, then seamlessly transitions to full API data when it arrives

- **Real-Time Playbar Progress**: The progress bar now updates every second instead of every 5 seconds when using native streaming
  - Enabled `position_update_interval` in librespot's PlayerConfig to receive periodic `PositionChanged` events
  - Added `is_streaming_active` flag to disable API-based progress calculation when native streaming is active
  - Progress bar time now shows accurate, real-time playback position (0:01, 0:02, 0:03...) instead of jumping in 5-second increments

## [0.33.3] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **Critical: UI Freeze on Rapid Pause/Play**: Fixed terminal freeze that occurred when rapidly pressing pause/play
  - Root cause: `handle_player_events` used blocking `lock().await` for every player event, creating a lock convoy with the main UI loop
  - Fix: Changed to non-blocking `try_lock()` - if lock is busy, skip the update (UI catches up on next tick)
- **Playbar Not Updating**: Fixed playbar only updating every 5 seconds instead of in real-time
  - Root cause: `get_current_playback()` incorrectly overwrote API's `is_playing` state with stale local state
  - Fix: `is_playing` is no longer preserved locally - it now comes from API responses and player events

## [0.33.2] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **Audio Visualization Now Works on `cargo install`**: Added `audio-viz-cpal` to default features so audio visualization works out of the box when installing via `cargo install spotatui`
  - Previously, only pre-built binaries had audio visualization enabled
  - Uses cross-platform `cpal` library for Windows, macOS, and Linux support

### Added

- **Volume Persistence**: Volume setting now persists across application restarts (thanks to Reddit user u/Ratox for the suggestion!)
  - Saved in `config.yml` under `behavior.volume_percent`
  - Applied automatically when native streaming starts

### Changed

- Updated README with detailed audio visualization platform support table:
  - **Windows**: Works out of the box (WASAPI loopback)
  - **Linux**: Works out of the box (PipeWire/PulseAudio monitor)
  - **macOS**: Requires virtual audio device (BlackHole or Loopback)

## [0.33.0] - 2025-12-08

- **Configuration Persistence**: Settings changes are saved immediately to `config.yml` - no restart required

### Changed

- Updated README with In-App Settings documentation and theme preset table
- Updated bug report template with terminal-specific fields (OS, Terminal, Version) instead of browser/smartphone fields
- **Native Streaming Optimizations**: When using native streaming, seek/pause/volume changes now happen instantly without API round-trips
- **Reduced API Delays**: Lowered playback control delays (seek: 1000ms → 200ms, next/prev: 250ms → 100ms) for snappier response
- Added Settings keybinding (`Alt-,`) to the help menu

### Fixed

- **Cross-Terminal Color Compatibility**: Use explicit RGB values instead of named ANSI colors throughout the UI for consistent rendering across terminals (fixes display issues on Kitty, Alacritty, etc.)
  - Audio visualization bar colors
  - Lyrics display (active/inactive lines)
  - Changelog section headers (Added/Fixed/Changed/etc.)
- **Streaming Player Events**: Improved player event handling to avoid deadlocks by releasing mutex locks before dispatching IO events
- **Settings Route Handling**: Added missing `RouteId::Settings` case in navigation handler to prevent unexpected behavior

- Credentials (auth token, chosen device, and CLIENT_ID & CLIENT_SECRET) are now all stored in the same place (`${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`), which closes [this issue](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/issues/4)
