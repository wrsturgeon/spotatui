# Changelog

## [0.34.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Catppuccin Mocha Theme Preset**: Added the popular Catppuccin Mocha Lavender color scheme as a new built-in theme preset (thanks @MysteriousWolf - PR #19)
- **Nix Support**: Added Nix derivation and build instructions for Nix users (thanks @copeison - PR #16)
  - Basic Nix derivation for building spotatui
  - Documentation for Nix-based installation

### Fixed

- **ALSA Warnings and Lock Contention**: Fixed ALSA warnings and lock contention issues that could cause freezing when viewing liked songs (thanks @rawcode1337 - PR #18, fixes #17)
- **External Device Playback Controls**: Fixed play/pause, skip, and volume controls not working when using the native Spotify app as the active playback device (fixes #14)

## [0.34.2] - 2025-12-13

### Added

- **Persistent Playback Device**: Saves the last used playback device (for example, `spotatui` or `spotifyd`) and re-selects it automatically on the next startup so playback resumes on the same device.


### Fixed

- **macOS SIGSEGV Crash on Startup**: Fixed segmentation fault when launching spotatui on macOS with Bluetooth audio devices connected
  - Switched from rodio to portaudio audio backend for macOS builds
  - Portaudio provides better compatibility with macOS CoreAudio and Bluetooth devices (AirPods, etc.)
  - Pre-built macOS binaries now use portaudio backend by default
  - Fixes crash during "Initializing Spirc" on macOS Sequoia and later

## [0.34.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **MPRIS D-Bus Integration (Linux)**: Desktop media control support for Linux users
  - Control spotatui via media keys (play/pause, next, previous)
  - Compatible with `playerctl` command-line tool
  - Desktop environment integration (GNOME, KDE media widgets)
  - Track metadata exposed (title, artist, album, duration)
  - Playback status and volume synced to D-Bus
  - Requires native streaming feature (enabled by default on Linux)

- **Multi-Page Playback Support**: Enhanced playback functionality for large playlists and saved tracks
  - Play seamlessly across all loaded pages, not just the current page
  - Automatically calculates correct track offset across multiple pages
  - Supports both saved tracks (Liked Songs) and playlists

- **Background Prefetching**: Intelligent prefetching system for improved performance
  - Automatically loads additional tracks in the background when viewing playlists or saved tracks
  - Prefetches up to 500 tracks (~10 pages) for seamless playback
  - Non-blocking implementation - prefetching runs in separate async tasks
  - Prefetched tracks are immediately available for playback without delay

### Fixed

- **First Song Playback Delay**: Fixed 5-10 second delay when playing the first song after startup
  - Root cause: Prefetch operations were blocking the network thread, preventing playback events from being processed
  - Fix: Converted prefetch operations to spawn as independent async tasks using `tokio::spawn()`
  - Result: Playback starts instantly while prefetching happens in the background

- **Track Skip Metadata Sync**: Implemented retry mechanism for track skip operations
  - Ensures Spotify API returns updated track metadata after skipping
  - Prevents showing stale track information in the UI
  - Improves reliability of track transitions


## [0.33.8] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

- **Smaller Binary Size**: Added Ratatui-recommended release optimizations, reducing binary size by ~62% (26MB → 9.9MB)
  - Enabled Link-Time Optimization (LTO)
  - Single codegen unit for better optimization
  - Strip debug symbols
  - Optimized for size (`opt-level = "s"`)
  - Thanks to zamazan4ik for the suggestion in Issue #5!

### Fixed

- **Next Track Skip Shows Stale Progress**: Fixed bug where skipping to the next track with native streaming would show stale progress from the previous song and appear paused
  - Root cause: `get_current_playback()` was preserving the old track's `is_playing` state (often `false` during transition), which overwrote the new track's correct state from the Spotify API
  - Fix: Only preserve volume, shuffle, and repeat states when native streaming is active - `is_playing` now comes from the API response or player events
  - Result: Playbar correctly shows "Playing" and reset progress when skipping tracks

- **Shuffle Not Actually Enabling with Native Streaming**: Shuffle preference is now sent to librespot on startup and when toggling, with device activation to ensure it applies; UI and saved config stay in sync so shuffle really plays shuffled.

- **Playbar Shows Old Track After Skip**: Fixed delay where playbar would briefly show the previous song's name/artist after skipping
  - Root cause: `native_track_info` (instant track info from native player) was unconditionally cleared when API response arrived, even if API returned stale data for the old track
  - Fix: Only clear `native_track_info` when API track name matches the native player's track
  - Result: Playbar immediately shows the new track's name from native player, only switching to API data when it catches up

## [0.33.7] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed

- **Artist View from Search**: Fixed issue where selecting an artist from search results would show a 404 error instead of loading the artist view
  - Root cause: The deprecated `related-artists` Spotify API endpoint was returning 404, blocking the entire artist view from loading
  - Fix: Made related artists fetch optional - artist view now loads successfully with albums and top tracks even if related artists endpoint fails
  - Related artists section will be empty when the endpoint is unavailable, but core artist information displays correctly

## [0.33.6] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **Persistent Volume**: Volume changes are saved immediately to `config.yml` and restored on startup so your level sticks between sessions
- **Persistent Shuffle**: Shuffle state is now saved and reapplied on launch, including when using native streaming, so you restart right where you left off
- (thanks u/Ratox for the ideas)

## [0.33.5] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed

- **Program Hanging on Exit**: Fixed issue where pressing "q" to exit the TUI would close the interface but leave the program running in the background
  - Root cause: Network thread continued running because the IO channel sender was never dropped, keeping the channel open indefinitely
  - Fix: Added `close_io_channel()` method that explicitly drops the sender when exiting, allowing the network thread to terminate gracefully
  - Result: Program now exits cleanly without requiring an additional Ctrl+C

- **Butter-Smooth Playbar Updates**: Completely rewrote playbar progress calculation for silky-smooth updates
  - **Previously**: Progress jumped every 5 seconds when the Spotify API was polled, causing visible stuttering
  - **Now**: Smooth incremental updates every tick (16ms by default, configurable via `tick_rate_milliseconds`)
  - **How it works**:
    - On each tick, progress increments by the tick rate when playing
    - Resyncs with Spotify API every 5 seconds to prevent drift
    - Responds to API updates within 300ms for instant feedback on play/pause/seek
  - **Result**: Progress bar now flows smoothly like a native music player, not in 5-second jumps
  - Optimized code paths to reduce CPU usage and unnecessary calculations

- **First Song Pause Bug**: Fixed issue where pausing the first song after startup required pressing pause twice
  - Root cause: `is_playing` state wasn't immediately updated to `true` when starting playback, staying `false` until API poll completed
  - Fix: Now immediately sets `is_playing = true` when `StartPlayback` succeeds, matching the behavior of resume playback
  - Result: Pause button works correctly on first press, even immediately after selecting a song

## [0.33.4] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **Instant Track Skip with Native Streaming**: When using native streaming, skipping tracks (n/p keys) now updates the playbar instantly
  - Previously, the UI waited for the Spotify API response before updating, causing a noticeable delay where you'd hear the new song while the playbar still showed the old song
  - Now uses the native player's `next()`/`prev()` methods via the Spirc controller for immediate skip
  - Added `NativeTrackInfo` - extracts track name, artists, and duration from librespot's `TrackChanged` event for instant playbar display
  - The playbar now shows native player info immediately, then seamlessly transitions to full API data when it arrives

- **Real-Time Playbar Progress**: The progress bar now updates every second instead of every 5 seconds when using native streaming
  - Enabled `position_update_interval` in librespot's PlayerConfig to receive periodic `PositionChanged` events
  - Added `is_streaming_active` flag to disable API-based progress calculation when native streaming is active
  - Progress bar time now shows accurate, real-time playback position (0:01, 0:02, 0:03...) instead of jumping in 5-second increments

## [0.33.3] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **Critical: UI Freeze on Rapid Pause/Play**: Fixed terminal freeze that occurred when rapidly pressing pause/play
  - Root cause: `handle_player_events` used blocking `lock().await` for every player event, creating a lock convoy with the main UI loop
  - Fix: Changed to non-blocking `try_lock()` - if lock is busy, skip the update (UI catches up on next tick)
- **Playbar Not Updating**: Fixed playbar only updating every 5 seconds instead of in real-time
  - Root cause: `get_current_playback()` incorrectly overwrote API's `is_playing` state with stale local state
  - Fix: `is_playing` is no longer preserved locally - it now comes from API responses and player events

## [0.33.2] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **Audio Visualization Now Works on `cargo install`**: Added `audio-viz-cpal` to default features so audio visualization works out of the box when installing via `cargo install spotatui`
  - Previously, only pre-built binaries had audio visualization enabled
  - Uses cross-platform `cpal` library for Windows, macOS, and Linux support

### Added

- **Volume Persistence**: Volume setting now persists across application restarts (thanks to Reddit user u/Ratox for the suggestion!)
  - Saved in `config.yml` under `behavior.volume_percent`

- **Reduced API Delays**: Lowered playback control delays (seek: 1000ms → 200ms, next/prev: 250ms → 100ms) for snappier response
- Added Settings keybinding (`Alt-,`) to the help menu

### Fixed
