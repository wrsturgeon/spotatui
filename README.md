A Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust.

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12150276/75177190-91d4ab00-572d-11ea-80bd-c5e28c7b17ad.gif)

The terminal in the demo above is using the [Rigel theme](https://rigel.netlify.com/).

## Privacy Notice

**🔒 Anonymous Global Counter**: Spotatui includes an opt-in feature that contributes to a global counter showing how many songs have been played by all users worldwide. This feature:

- **Is completely anonymous** - no personal information, song names, artists, or listening history is collected
- **Only sends a simple increment** when a new song starts playing
- **Is enabled by default** but can be opted out at any time
- **Can be disabled** by setting `enable_global_song_count: false` in `~/.config/spotatui/config.yml`

We respect your privacy. This is purely a fun community metric with zero tracking of individual users.

## Migrating from spotify-tui

If you used the original `spotify-tui` before:

- The binary name changed from `spt` → `spotatui`.
- Config paths changed:
  - Old: `~/.config/spotify-tui/`
  - New: `~/.config/spotatui/`

You can copy your existing config:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/spotatui
cp -r ~/.config/spotify-tui/* ~/.config/spotatui/
```

You may be asked to re-authenticate with Spotify the first time.

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/releases/latest):

| Platform                           | File                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Windows 10/11 (64-bit)             | `spotatui-windows-x86_64.zip`         |
| Linux (Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, etc.) | `spotatui-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`        |
| Linux (Alpine / musl)              | `spotatui-linux-alpine-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| macOS (Intel)                      | `spotatui-macos-x86_64.tar.gz`        |
| macOS (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3)     | `spotatui-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`       |

Checksums (`.sha256`) are provided if you want to verify the download.

#### Linux Requirements

For audio visualization on Linux, you need PipeWire installed:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libpipewire-0.3-0

# Arch Linux (already included with pipewire)
sudo pacman -S pipewirelibssl-dev pkg-config

# Fedora (already included with pipewire)
sudo dnf install pipewire
```

> **Note:** Most modern Linux distributions already have PipeWire installed by default.

### Cargo

If you have Rust installed:

```bash
cargo install spotatui
```

> **Note (Linux/WSL):** If you get a `linker 'cc' not found` error, install build tools first:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config
> ```

### Building from Source

Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui.git
    cd spotatui
    ```

2.  Install using Cargo:
    ```bash
    cargo install --path .
    ```

    Or build and run directly:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```

## Connecting to Spotify’s API

`spotatui` needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by
name, play tracks etc.

Instructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.

But here they are again:

1. Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
1. Click `Create an app`
    - You now can see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
1. Now click `Edit Settings`
1. Add the following Redirect URIs (use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` as Spotify no longer allows `localhost`):
    - `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` (for API authentication)
    - `http://127.0.0.1:8989/login` (for native streaming - see [Native Streaming](#native-streaming-experimental))
1. Scroll down and click `Save`
1. You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!
1. Go back to the terminal
1. Run `spotatui`
1. Enter your `Client ID`
1. Enter your `Client Secret`
1. Press enter to confirm the default port (8888) or enter a custom port
1. You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.
1. After accepting the permissions, you'll be redirected to localhost. If all goes well, the redirect URL will be parsed automatically and now you're done. If the local webserver fails for some reason you'll be redirected to a blank webpage that might say something like "Connection Refused" since no server is running. Regardless, copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal.

And now you are ready to use `Spotatui` 🎉

You can edit the config at anytime at `${HOME}/.config/spotatui/client.yml`.

## Usage

The binary is named `spotatui`.

Running `spotatui` with no arguments will bring up the UI. Press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions.
There is also a CLI that is able to do most of the stuff the UI does. Use `spotatui --help` to learn more.

Here are some example to get you excited.
```
spotatui --completions zsh # Prints shell completions for zsh to stdout (bash, power-shell and more are supported)

spotatui play --name "Your Playlist" --playlist --random # Plays a random song from "Your Playlist"
spotatui play --name "A cool song" --track # Plays 'A cool song'

spotatui playback --like --shuffle # Likes the current song and toggles shuffle mode
spotatui playback --toggle # Plays/pauses the current playback

spotatui list --liked --limit 50 # See your liked songs (50 is the max limit)

# Looks for 'An even cooler song' and gives you the '{name} from {album}' of up to 30 matches
spotatui search "An even cooler song" --tracks --format "%t from %b" --limit 30
```

## Native Streaming (Experimental)

Spotatui now includes **native Spotify Connect** support, allowing it to play audio directly on your computer without needing an external player like spotifyd.

### Setup

The native streaming feature uses a separate authentication flow. On first run:

1. Your browser will open to Spotify's authorization page
2. **Important:** The redirect URI will be `http://127.0.0.1:8989/login` - this is different from the main app's callback URL
3. After authorizing, "Spotatui" will appear in your Spotify Connect device list
4. Credentials are cached so you only need to do this once

### How It Works

- When streaming is enabled, "Spotatui" registers as a Spotify Connect device
- You can control playback from the TUI, your phone, or any other Spotify client
- Audio plays directly on the computer running spotatui

### Notes

- Native streaming is **enabled by default** when built with the `streaming` feature
- Premium account is required for playback
- The streaming authentication uses a different client than the main app's API controls

# Configuration

A configuration file is located at `${HOME}/.config/spotatui/config.yml`.
(not to be confused with client.yml which handles spotify authentication)

The following is a sample config.yml file:

```yaml
# Sample config file

# The theme colours can be an rgb string of the form "255, 255, 255" or a string that references the colours from your terminal theme: Reset, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, Gray, DarkGray, LightRed, LightGreen, LightYellow, LightBlue, LightMagenta, LightCyan, White.
theme:
  active: Cyan # current playing song in list
  banner: LightCyan # the "spotatui" banner on launch
  error_border: Red # error dialog border
  error_text: LightRed # error message text (e.g. "Spotify API reported error 404")
  hint: Yellow # hint text in errors
  hovered: Magenta # hovered pane border
  inactive: Gray # borders of inactive panes
  playbar_background: Black # background of progress bar
  playbar_progress: LightCyan # filled-in part of the progress bar
  playbar_progress_text: Cyan # song length and time played/left indicator in the progress bar
  playbar_text: White # artist name in player pane
  selected: LightCyan # a) selected pane border, b) hovered item in list, & c) track title in player
  text: "255, 255, 255" # text in panes
  header: White # header text in panes (e.g. 'Title', 'Artist', etc.)

behavior:
  seek_milliseconds: 5000
  volume_increment: 10
  # The lower the number the higher the "frames per second". You can decrease this number so that the audio visualisation is smoother but this can be expensive!
  tick_rate_milliseconds: 250
  # Enable text emphasis (typically italic/bold text styling). Disabling this might be important if the terminal config is otherwise restricted and rendering text escapes interferes with the UI.
  enable_text_emphasis: true
  # Controls whether to show a loading indicator in the top right of the UI whenever communicating with Spotify API
  show_loading_indicator: true
  # Disables the responsive layout that makes the search bar smaller on bigger
  # screens and enforces a wide search bar
  enforce_wide_search_bar: false
  # Contribute to the global song counter (completely anonymous, no PII collected)
  # Set to false to opt out of contributing to the global counter
  enable_global_song_count: true
  # Determines the text icon to display next to "liked" Spotify items, such as
  # liked songs and albums, or followed artists. Can be any length string.
  # These icons require a patched nerd font.
  liked_icon: ♥
  shuffle_icon: 🔀
  repeat_track_icon: 🔂
  repeat_context_icon: 🔁
  playing_icon: ▶
  paused_icon: ⏸
  # Sets the window title to "spotatui - Spotify TUI" via ANSI escape code.
  set_window_title: true

keybindings:
  # Key stroke can be used if it only uses two keys:
  # ctrl-q works,
  # ctrl-alt-q doesn't.
  back: "ctrl-q"

  jump_to_album: "a"

  # Shift modifiers use a capital letter (also applies with other modifier keys
  # like ctrl-A)
  jump_to_artist_album: "A"

  manage_devices: "d"
  decrease_volume: "-"
  increase_volume: "+"
  toggle_playback: " "
  seek_backwards: "<"
  seek_forwards: ">"
  next_track: "n"
  previous_track: "p"
  copy_song_url: "c"
  copy_album_url: "C"
  help: "?"
  shuffle: "ctrl-s"
  repeat: "r"
  search: "/"
  audio_analysis: "v"
  jump_to_context: "o"
  basic_view: "B"
  add_item_to_queue: "z"
```

## Limitations

This app uses the [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) from Spotify, which doesn't handle streaming itself. You have three options for audio playback:

1. **Native Streaming (NEW!)** - Spotatui can now play audio directly using its built-in streaming feature. See [Native Streaming](#native-streaming-experimental) below.
2. **Official Spotify Client** - Have the official Spotify app open on your computer
3. **Spotifyd** - Use a lightweight alternative like [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)

If you want to play tracks, Spotify requires that you have a Premium account.

### Deprecated Spotify API Features

**Note:** As of November 2024, Spotify deprecated and removed access to certain API endpoints for new applications. The following features are included in this app but **will only work if your Spotify Developer application was created before November 27, 2024**:

- **Audio Visualization** (press `v`): Now uses **local real-time FFT analysis** of your system audio. On Linux, this requires PipeWire. The visualization no longer depends on Spotify's deprecated Audio Analysis API.
  > **Note:** The audio visualization is **system-wide** – it captures all audio playing on your system, not just Spotify. This means it will also react to YouTube videos, games, or any other audio source!
- **Related Artists**: When viewing an artist page, the "Related Artists" section shows similar artists based on Spotify's recommendation algorithm. This feature **only works if your Spotify Developer application was created before November 27, 2024**.

For more information, see [Spotify's announcement about API changes](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api).

## Using with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)

> **Note:** If you're using native streaming, you don't need spotifyd!

Follow the spotifyd documentation to get set up.

After that there is not much to it.

1. Start running the spotifyd daemon.
1. Start up `spotatui`
1. Press `d` to go to the device selection menu and the spotifyd "device" should be there - if not check [these docs](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#logging)

## Libraries used

- [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui)
- [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify)

## Development

1. [Install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic)
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [Install `xorg-dev`](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard#prerequisites) (required for clipboard support)
1. **Linux only:** Install PipeWire development libraries (required for audio visualization)
   ```bash
   # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install libpipewire-0.3-dev libspa-0.2-dev
   
   # Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S pipewire
   
   # Fedora
   sudo dnf install pipewire-devel
   ```
1. Clone or fork this repo and `cd` to it
1. And then `cargo run`

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

You might get a linking error. If so, you'll probably need to install additional dependencies required by the clipboard package

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y -qq pkg-config libssl-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
```

## Roadmap

The goal is to eventually implement almost every Spotify feature.

### High-level requirements yet to be implemented

- Add songs to a playlist
- Be able to scroll through result pages in every view

This table shows all that is possible with the Spotify API, what is implemented already, and whether that is essential.
