# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We maintain security fixes only for the current stable release stream.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories (Security > Report a vulnerability) instead of opening a public issue.
- Include details that help us reproduce and assess impact: spotatui version, OS, installation method, minimal repro steps, and any relevant logs (with secrets stripped).
- You can expect an acknowledgment within 3 business days and status updates at least weekly until resolution.
- If the issue is confirmed, we will coordinate a fix and release notes before public disclosure.***
